<p>
    A company, abbreviated as co., is a legal entity representing an
     association of people, whether natural, legal or a mixture of both, with a specific objective. Company members share a 
     common purpose and unite to achieve specific,
    declared goals. Companies take various forms, such as:
    </p>
    
            <ul>
             <li>voluntary associations, which may include nonprofit organizations</li>
             <li>business entities, whose aim is generating profit</li>
             <li>financial entities and banks</li>
             <li>programs or educational institutions.</li>




            </ul>

<p>

    A company can be created as a legal person so that the company itself has limited liability as members perform or
     fail to discharge their duty according to the publicly declared incorporation, or published policy. When a company 
     closes, it may need to be liquidated 
    to avoid further legal obligations.

<b>Meanings and definitions</b><hr>

    A company can be defined as an "artificial person", invisible, intangible, created by or under law,[1] with a 
    discrete legal personality, perpetual succession, and a common seal. Except for some senior positions, companies
     remain unaffected by the death, 
    insanity, or insolvency of an individual member.

<i><b>Etymology</b></i>

<p>
    The English word company has its origins in the Old French term compagnie (first recorded in 1150), meaning a "society, 
    friendship, intimacy; body of soldiers",[2] which came from the Late Latin word companio ("one who eats bread with you"), 
    first attested in the Lex Salica (English: Salic Law) (c. 500 CE) as a calque 
    of the Germanic expression gahlaibo (literally, "with bread"), related to Old High German galeipo ("companion") and to 
    Gothic gahlaiba ("messmate").
